        <h1 class="pager">Dalton Polhill</h1>
        <p class="pager">I am co-op student at the university of Guelph, currently working towards a bachelors of computing
            with a major in Computer Science and a Minor in Business. I have just completed my first work term
            with Tulip Retail in Toronto. Throughout the 4 month work term I was able to use many of the skills I learned
            in the classroom to assist me in accomplishing tasks in timely manners.
            I had an opportunity to apply my knowledge in a hands on environment, which I feel is extremely
            valuable and will help me grow in my career.
            I hope to use my future work terms to try out new areas of the industry and expand my knowledge,
            I have a particular interest in cyber security, hardware, artificial intelligence systems and code optimizations.

                    <p>The OWASP Juice Shop is a purposely vulnerable website meant to be a training tool for web security
                        vulnerabilities, which include the OWASP top 10!
                        Being a web application with 43 intended security vulnerabilities, the OWASP Juice Shop
                        is supposed to be the opposite of a best practice or template application for web developers:
                        It is an awareness, training, demonstration and exercise tool for security risks in modern
                        web applications. The OWASP Juice Shop is an open-source project hosted by the non-profit
                        pen Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and is developed and maintained by volunteers.

                        This kit is an amazing learning tool for use with Arduino. The SunFounder Uno R3 
                        board is used as control, along with a step-down DC to DC converterto reduce 
                        voltage input. A sensor shield can be used as an I/O device to talk to the Arduino, 
                        allowing the car to maneuver obstacles, follow infrared laser and even detect shadows.
                        This kit is a great way to start integrating code with hardware!
