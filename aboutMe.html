        <h1 class="pager">Dalton Polhill</h1>
        <p class="pager">I am co-op student at the university of Guelph, currently working towards a bachelors of computing
            with a major in Computer Science and a Minor in Business. I have just completed my first three work terms, which 
            have given me an abundance of real world industry experience.

            I completed my first 4 month coop term at Tulip Retail in Toronto where I was able to use many of the skills I 
            learned in the classroom in real world scenarios and gain an insight to what the software development industry was 
            actually like. I had an opportunity to apply my knowledge in a hands on environment, which I feel is extremely
            valuable and will help me grow in my career.

            I moved on to Brock Solutions for my second work term in hopes to experience different types of work enviroments
            and to gain more industry knowledge. This move allowed me expand my comfort zone into a completely different industry
            and sharpen a completely different set of skills. At Brock Solutions I was much more involved in creating automation
            tools and using complex algorithms to solve real world, real-time problems.

            For my third coop work term I travelled to a completely different sector of the industry, start ups. Revyoome is, 
            every definition of the word, a start up company. I was literally employee number 1 at the company, and helped the 
            CEO pick out the laptops we would be using to develop the project. This was an incredible experience for me, as I 
            was given the opportunity to be the project manager and senior technical leader. This was the most unique opportunity 
            for many reasons, the fact that I was able to make design decisions before any code was even written, make decisions
            about how we would build the backend and even design the database. 

            I hope to use my future work terms to try out new areas of the industry and expand my knowledge even further,
            I have a particular interest in cyber security, artificial intelligence systems and code optimizations.

                    <p>The OWASP Juice Shop is a purposely vulnerable website meant to be a training tool for web security
                        vulnerabilities, which include the OWASP top 10!
                        Being a web application with 43 intended security vulnerabilities, the OWASP Juice Shop
                        is supposed to be the opposite of a best practice or template application for web developers:
                        It is an awareness, training, demonstration and exercise tool for security risks in modern
                        web applications. The OWASP Juice Shop is an open-source project hosted by the non-profit
                        pen Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and is developed and maintained by volunteers.

                        This kit is an amazing learning tool for use with Arduino. The SunFounder Uno R3 
                        board is used as control, along with a step-down DC to DC converterto reduce 
                        voltage input. A sensor shield can be used as an I/O device to talk to the Arduino, 
                        allowing the car to maneuver obstacles, follow infrared laser and even detect shadows.
                        This kit is a great way to start integrating code with hardware!
