                                    A big part about working in a team to build a new app is
                                    communication, the value of communication is high when
                                    developing something that has never been done before. I want
                                    to be able to improve my written and oral communication skill
                                    throughout this work term.

                                    I have implemented a scum methodology with my team, and will be doing a standup meeting with them every single work day.
                                    Also I will be using Slack as a communication tool, and Phabricator to develop plans and scrum boards to be used for
                                    further communications with the team. I also plan to keep a running log of wiki's on how to complete certain tasks for future
                                    onboarding.

                                    I would think that a good measure of success for this goal would be the success of the project, but a more 
                                    obscure way of telling that I am meeting this goal is to have my team members
                                    communicating openly with myself. If i am doing a good job communicating with my team then I should know when there are
                                    issues arising within the project, and not be surprised by them popping up out of the blue.

                                    I feel that I have kept up with the daily scrum, and weekly sprint planning meetings well, and done a good job
                                    communicating with my team when there is a problem. I also feel that I have been able to make myself available to 
                                    my team as often as possible when they are in need of assistance.

                                    Within the project we are using many different tools such
                                    as Android Studio, xCode and AWS and languages like Java
                                    and Swift. There are a lot of tasks that must be completed in this
                                    project that I have no experience with. So my goal is to widen my
                                    knowledge and learn a breadth of knowledge about these
                                    various tools and languages.

                                    much as possible to imerse myself in them and get plenty of
                                    practice. I plan to do a lot of reading of the documentation of
                                    these tools and playing around with there different
                                    implementations and use cases.

                                    amount about these tools and languages.

                                    I have spent a lot of time coding in both Android Studio and xCode over the passed few months, and feel 
                                    that based on my knowledge from before this term and now, I have learned a lot. I feel that my skills with 
                                    xCode and Swift have become significantly better, as well as the amount of enjoyment I get out of coding for iOS 
                                    applications has increased significantly.

                                    I plan to be as open as i can with my team and use their
                                    strengths to the benefit of the team while being supportive of
                                    their weaknesses. I want to see my team grow and evolve in
                                    their work and be able to complete tasks without too much stress
                                    and with as much help from me as possible.

                                    One way to measure this goal would be to ask for feedback from
                                    my team about how my leadership was during the term and to
                                    ask my manager how he thought i did as a mentor as well.

                                    I have asked for feedback from my team as well as my manager and formulated a plan for myself to improve even further
                                    on these team management skills. The feedback that I recieved was quite positive and I was overwhelmed to hear that my team 
                                    believed that I was a well suited leader. I am determined to continue my growth as a leader.
