                                    communicating with the team and with developers in efficient ways, to be able to
                                    get effective help fast and an emphasis on asking "good" questions to the right people.

                                    obscure way of telling that I am meeting this goal is to have my team members
                                    communicating openly with myself. If i am doing a good job communicating with my team then I should know when there are
                                    issues arising within the project, and not be surprised by them popping up out of the blue.

                                    Time management is an extremely important skill for software developers, at Adknown
                                    it is an important skill to practise in order to be able to complete tasks efficiently.
                                    My goal is to be able to complete tasks more efficiently in order to complete them as
                                    close to the estimate time of completion set out by my managers.

                                    In order to complete a task efficiently I must first understand what the task is asking,
                                    the scope of work, and an example test case or reproduction steps. I will make an effort
                                    to read, understand and analyze the task first, making detailed notes about the aforementioned.
                                    If any parts are unclear I will reach out to the appropriate parties for clarification.

                                    I will also set up automatic reminders for myself to ensure I am up to date on my time
                                    tracking and hours logged each day. Making notes in the time logged about what
                                    I worked on / accomplished.

                                    Ill be sure to reach out to someone for help if I am stuck on a task for more than
                                    15 minutes, as expected by managers at Adknown.

                                    I would really like to become more masterful of the lingo within different domains
                                    of knowledge. In particular, this semester I have been asked to work with javascript
                                    in frontend development, something I have very little exposure to and do not understand
                                    well. I will strive to practise and learn as much as I can about using javacript.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    I think this comes a lot from communicating with people who know the domain better
                                    than myself and asking questions (or researching) about terms they talk to me about.
                                    In terms of becoming a better javascript programmer, there is a lot of practise involved
                                    in mastering a language, which I will make sure to seek out as many chances
                                    to work with js code as I possibly can during the semester.

                                    By the end of the term I think one way to measure how successful I am with this
                                    goal would be to have a conversation with my manager or another developer in a field
                                    I feel I have expanded my vernacular in and see how well I fair in a complex
                                    conversation with the domain lingo.

                                    I had a large leadership role in my previous coop and learned alot from being in that
                                    position, I would like to strive to continue learning and developing as a leader during this term.

                                    Having a mentor during the term is an excellent opportunity to shadow another person
                                    in their day to day and be able to mimmick their leadership behavior.

                                    I think the best way to measure this goal will be to ask for feedback from
                                    my mentor and manager throughout the term.
