        <p> I was given an incredible learning opportunity at Revyoome, a chance to expand my knowledge 
            exponentially and get a feel for being a leader within the industry. I was exposed to the 
            unique atmosphere of the first days of a startup, before any infrastructure was in place whatsoever.
            This was one of the most unique opportunities a coop student in my position could ask for, and I am 
            very greatful. 
            <br><br>
            One major advantage I gained from the position I held at Revyoome is the emmense amount of exposure I 
            got to various technologies. I was placed in charge of many important parts of the project which 
            gave me the opportunity to learn about many things I wouldn't have in other positions, such as web server setups
            serverless backend construction for a mobile applications and especially managing a project.
            <br><br>
            I had some very amazing learning experiences and would absolutely recommend working for a startup such as this if you enjoy 
            a challenging and rewarding workplace.
