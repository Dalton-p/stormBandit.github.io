            <h1>Thank You!</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="pager" style="text-align: left;">
            <p>There are many people I would like to thank for the support and advice I have been given
                over the course of my post-secondary career. First and foremost a big thanks to
                Laura Gatto, my co-op coordinator who has helped me throughout my career as a co-op
                student. Laura helped me enter into the co-op program, build a comprehensive resume
                which helped me land a job as an undergraduate research assistant even before my first
                co-op work term. Laura has been there to support me during my co-op terms and is always
                happy to help with any questions or concerns I may have. She is a great mentor and friend!
                <br><br>
                I would also like to thank Greg Klotz, the coordinator for the school of computer science.
                Greg has been a tremendous help when it came to choosing courses and deciding my career path,
                Greg was able to guide me into the proper courses that would benefit me most in what I wished
                to do after graduation.
