                                    I would like to become better at communicating with others about systems and 
									processes within the system. I find that when colleagues of mine are speaking in 
									depth about how a system works I can become lost. As well when I try to explain 
									myself to others I can confuse even myself in trying to explain how something 
									I have developed works.

									Each day at Brock we do a scrum where the team gets together and we share what we 
									were working on the previous day, what has us stuck, and any other questions we 
									have that the team ma be able to answer. Scrum gives us all a good chance to catch 
									up with eachother, learn about other parts of the project and ask questions to 
									clarify misunderstandings. I will take full advantage of these scrum sessions in 
									order to improve my oral communication.

                                    The best way to measure whether or not I have become a better oral communicator is 
									within those scrum sessions, when I explain my process to others and realize that 
									they are following along and understand what I mean, then I will feel like I have 
									achieved this goal. Although it is always something that can be improved.

                                    One definitive way to know whether or not I have progessed on a goal during a work term
                                    is to hear my supervisor's thoughts on the goal. In this case, my talent manager told me 
                                    that I have shown progress on this goal within my four months at Brock. He told me that 
                                    I became much better at communicating through the online services such as Jira and 
                                    Perforce and I was skilled in communicating during our daily scrums and during conference
                                    calls over skype. I feel that I did improve over the course of the term and became a better 
                                    communicator accross all the platforms that we used at Brock.

                                    The system I am working with here at Brock is very large, sometimes it is 
									extremely difficult to read the code and understand what is going on, this is 
									a skill I would like to develop. It is important to be able to read old code, 
									know how it works and what it is doing, to the be able to modify that code. 
									This code is also very sparsely commented, so understanding the naming techniques 
									of various classes and methods will help with this goal.

                                    The best way to get better at something is to practice. Reading and 
									understanding old code is something we must do every time we are given 
									a new task, so I believe there is plenty of time in this work term for 
									me to practice and refine this skill.

                                    This skill is one that will be difficut to measure, by the end of the term I 
									should be familiar with the structure of the code and the conventions used, 
									which will aid me in understanding the code. If I am still unable to read a

									accomplished this goal.

                                    In the beginning of my work term, the stack at Brock was very overwhelming, but
                                    as I worked through various parts of the stack on different projects the structure
                                    and layout of it all began to make more sense to me. With that I was much more easily
                                    able to navigate the source code and find what I was looking for in order to begin work.
                                    This skill is one that I will constantly be trying to improve upon, and I feel that these
                                    past four months were very beneficial in this aspect.

									One of the goals I am most ambitious to meet, but also may take the longest time to accomplish,
									is being more independant. I would like to be able to sit down, start a project 
									and complete that project without needing aid from other people. I find that I 
									am unable to do highly complex things without the help of another person that i 
									can explain my questions to and they can answer them. It is a problem of not really
									knowing what I'm trying to do (or what the industry calls that thing) to be able to 
									look it up myself.

                                    I will have accompished this goal when I feel confident to do a project 
									without having to message a colleague and ask "how do I do this" but instead I 
									can do a quick internet search myself or figure it out in the code on my own.

                                    This was another goal that I was very proud to hear my supervisor say, that I 
                                    had made progress on. I also feel very accomplished in this goal, as I was able
                                    to figure a lot of things out on my own with very little help. Completing complicated
                                    tasks by myself makes me feel great, especially when I am able to do it in a time 
                                    frame that sometimes surprised my supervisors.

                                    Using the language on a day-to-day basis will help build my understanding of 
									it, asking questions when the way we have done things is not clear, and using my
									online resources as a tool for understanding concepts within the language helps.

                                    Did I master Java ? Well no probably not, but for my level of experience I definetely
                                    feel like I achieved my goal. I learned a lot of things about Java that make the 
                                    languange very powerful and make my time developing shorter. I feel as though if I
                                    went back and re-took that Java Programming course I would fall asleep during lectures 
                                    and whiz through the assignments.

                                    The knowledge i need to be successful when programming on a windows machine 
									lies within my colleagues. I have already been shown so many different little 
									trickt to make life easier on a Windows machine. Perforce and JIRA are tools 
									that are very new to me and again my colleagues are probably the best resource 
									for help on these, but as always the internet will also be a good place to find

                                    This goal was probably the easiest to accomplish, I mean really all I had to do was 
                                    show up. Learning Perforce was an interesting curve in the beginning, but I got the 
                                    hang of it quite quickly. Jira was very similar to Phabricator which I have used previously.
                                    As for coding on a Windows machine, I learned all the commands and tricks that helped with
                                    my specific job quickly. Although we did not use the command prompt very often, which
                                    is something I would like to expand my knowledge on in the future.
