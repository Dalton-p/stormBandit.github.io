            <strong>Official Title:</strong> Product Manager and Senior Technical Leader
            <br><br>
            Revyoome is a brand new startup (2018) interested in developing a new video based social media application
            for both Android and iOS mobile platforms. With the project just starting, there were a group of 5 employees acting
            as both the development and design team. We are looking for brilliant developer(s) with strong Apple iOS Swift 
            experience who have a passion for mobile and enjoy developing in a fast-paced, innovative environment. As an iOS 
            developer at revyoo.me you'll be able to get in on the ground floor of an innovative mobile video technology company. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>Expectations:</strong><br>
                •    Implement new features in the revyoo.me mobile app<br>
                •    Work in a small team environment and ship code<br>
                •    Contribute ideas and participate in design and planning discussions<br>
                •    Contribute to everything from low-level networking and parsing, to application logic, to UI implementation
            <br><br>
            <strong>Experience We Like:</strong><br>
                •    Strong knowledge of iOS  and experience with Swift<br>
                •    Prior involvement in implementing a feature from specification to completion<br>
                •    Real-world mobile development experience (through work or personal projects)
            <br><br>
            <strong>My Experience at Revyoome:</strong> <br>
                Few people can say that they were the first employee hired for any company, I was hired as the senior technical
            lead and the product manager. Although these were my official titles, often times in a startup environment the roles
            we take on tend to blend together into many other roles.
            <br><br>
                Some days I acted entirely as a the companies database administrator, spending my time researching better ways to desing our 
            quickly growing data model, and how to increase efficient of our MySQL queries. I spent an entire day with an outside consultant
            planning and designing the use cases of our data model before ever beginning to build up our database. I learned that it is a huge advantage
            to plan out as many possible use cases before ever starting to development a database schema and to try and anticipate various modifications that
            may come down the line. The time it takes to plan this out is minimal compared to the time it takes to rework your entire database design because of a 
            new feature the client asks for. There were a few times throughout the term where I had to rework the schema in order to accompany a new feature, and many 
            of these cases could have been avoided if I had done more searching for best practices in the first stages of design. One of the most valuable lessons I learned
            while working with the databae for Revyoome was that no matter what I was trying to accomplish, my first solution to the problem was almost always less efficient
            than some other solution. Five minutes on stackoverflow was often all it took to find a better solution or to learn a new tool that is built into the MySQL engine.
            We decided to use <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/rds>Amazon RDS</a> to host our database because of its flexible, scalable and overall ease of use. No set up
            of servers or maintenence on our end meant more time for developing!
            <br><br>
                Many of my days were spent as the project manager, performing code reviews, testing completed user stories and merging tasks into the development environment.
            I constructed a <a href=https://www.phacility.com/phabricator>Phabricator</a> project, running on an <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/ec2>Amazon EC2</a> instance, for 
            project management purposes. Phabricator is a great tool for managing task creation and tracking, and has
            built in Git support, which is crucial to be able to perform code reviews without compromising the main development branch. A major 
            lesson I learned during the course of my work term is the importance of using version control software properly. It is importance to always having a branch dedicated
            to working code, for the purpose of always having a place to branch off from to start a new task and more importantly to have a demonstratable product at all times. Nothing
            is more frustrating then trying to demo to the client (or in this case the CEO) and have a bug on the current branch. 
            <br><br>
                I was given the unique opportunity to manage the entire project of Revyoome, which meant that I was in charge of the user story creation and assignment
            for both the Android and iOS side of the development team. I also did my fair share of development for both sides of the mobile application, which was very rewarding
            in that I now have experience in both Swift and Java for mobile development. A major piece of the application that I contributed to both the Android and iOS side was the 
            sign-up, sign-in and sign-out process. I used <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/ >Amazon Cognito</a> to authenticate users to be given access to our serverless backend.
            <br><br>
                Speaking of the backend, one of my largest responsibilities was the design and development of our entire backend, including our <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/apigateway/ >Amazon API Gateway</a>
            which featured all of the endpoints to our backend serverless <a href= https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/ >Amazon Lambda</a> functions. We used NodeJS to write our 
            backend code because of its asynchronous abilities and because I really wanted to get to know this language due to its growing popularity. At first there were 
            a lot of issues with how the code ran asynchronously, but once I got the hang of using Promises, it became a very powerful and efficient tool.
