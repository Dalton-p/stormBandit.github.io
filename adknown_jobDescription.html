            <strong>My Experience at Adknown:</strong> <br>

                My experience with Adknown started out with the interview process, which  very much enjoyed. After applying to the position I was promptly emailed
            an online test similar to many other companies in the same space. The in person interview was very well organized in my opinion and I had a lot of fun with it.
            The interview was conducted in a room with a whiteboard where I was encouraged to display my solutions to technical questions, and explain my thinking.
            After the first round of more theoretical technical questions, the interviewer handed me their laptop and told me that I was to use it during the next exercise
            to research any solutions to the problem they proposed. They began to go through a role playing scenario where I was acting as a developer trying to help
            a business man with their company website. This was a very interesting approach to a technical interview and gave me an opportunity to show that with a
            computer in hand I was able to find a solution to problems that may seem more difficult at first. The important part for a developer is that they can find
            a solution to a problem not memorize them all.
            <br><br>
                The orientation at Adknown was also very well organized, they came up with a way for the company and their coops to both benefit greatly during the
            onboarding process. They did this through creating a project idea for the coops to work on together that would eventually become an internal tool for the
            company to use in the future. In our case, we were building a Time Off Tracking Platform, where employees would be able to book time off for various reasons
            and they platform would handle reminding team members of absences ad well as requesting the approval from management.
            During the orientation period the team of coops worked together on the project and had a project manager dev assigned to the project to oversee and help
            teach. This was much better than simply giving us a tutorial to follow or pdf to read through. There were many opportunities during the project to use different
            technologies and learn new tools. During this process I was mainly responsible for creating the data model, building out a database schema, and creating the
            data access layer for the project. I also worked on setting up the nginx configuration and routing for the site.
            <br><br>
                Once the orientation project was over each of the coops was placed with a mentor, my mentor was mainly responsible for working on all the internal tools
            used by employees throughout the company to aid in completing their work. This was an incredible opportunity for me because there were several different projects
            that I was tasked with updating, fixing, adding to or replacing. This provided a wide range of technologies that I was able to work with, and continued to provide
            me with different challenges.
            <br><br>
                This term I was able to work with a variety of technologies, sharpening my skills with some familiar to me and being introduced to new ones. I spent quite a
            bit of time learning new, more indepth ways to use <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> to host
            my local working environment. As well as honing my <a href="http://www.php.net/">Php</a> skills for both backend scripting and its powerful OOP capabilities. I had a lot of
            exposure to frontend programming as well, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">javascript</a>
            (<a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/">ajax</a>) to accomplish complex tasks and improve the user experience.
