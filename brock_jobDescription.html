            Official Title: Full-Stack Developer
            <br><br>
            Description: <br>
			Brock Solutions is an engineering solutions and professional services 
			company specializing in the design, build and implementation of real-time 
			solutions for broad based industrial/manufacturing and transportation/logistics 
			organizations globally. With approximately 400 employees in Canada and the U.S., 
			As a developer at Brock Solutions, you will get the opportunity to explore the newest 
			technologies, designs, platforms, and programming concepts. Innovative ideas are 
			encouraged and used throughout the lifecycle of our applications.

            <br><br>
            My role:<br>
            * Understand and contribute to a growing, complex stack<br>
            * Test, review and debug code written by me <br>
            * Add new as well as contribute to existing modules within the stack<br>
            * Follow team based procedures for code creation, testing and submission
            <br><br>
            Expectations:<br>
            * Have a strong desire to learn new technologies<br>
            * Experience with: Java, Version Control, Team Based Development<br>
            * Efficient and effective problem solving

            My Time at Brock Solutions:<br>
            During my 4 month co-op at Brock Solutions I worked on a team which serviced the client <a href="http://www.hexcel.com/">hexcel.com</a>
			The team was spread out between the Kitchener office, where I worked, and the Dallas office. This added an
			interesting aspect to the team dynamic that I had never experienced before. I was greatful for the opportunity to
			experience having a team that was expected to work cohesively together despite being so far apart.
            My Expectations:<br>
			* Gain a firm understanding of the existing stack and become familiar with common practises <br>
			* Build up confidence with the Java programming language as well as its JUnit Testing approaches <br>
			* Acquire knowledge of programming on a Windows machine, using Perorce, JIRA and other software <br>                     
            * Communicate effectively with the team about current tasks <br>
