            Revyoome is a startup company developing an iOS and Android application for bringing the online world 
            of reviewing information into the ever booming social media industry. As the company is still early in its stages of growth and much of the content we worked on is private, 
            there is not much that I can disclose about the actual product of the company. However I can speak about my experience during this unique opportunity. 
            As a third year university student I could never have imagined myself being placed in a management position
            to lead a team of developers to build a mobile application from the ground up.
        </p>
        <p>
            My role at Revyoome was to manage a small team of developers and to oversee the development, quality management
            and testing of the software as well contribute to the design of the application. As a team we built an entire 
            cloud based backend infrastructure to a mobile application using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
            I built a <a href=https://www.phacility.com/phabricator>Phabricator</a> instance on an <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/ec2>AWS EC2</a> instance to host our project management and code review software.
            We used phabricator to enforce organization on the project, help with task workflow and have a well established
            form of communication throughout the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was directly involved in designing, implementing and continuously improving a data model and mysql database 
            schema for the project. The data model continually got more complex, adding new functionality to the app meant 
            adding new components to the backend database. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I was also responsible for performing code reviews on a regular basis while managing a development and beta 
            environment. Both environments consisted of their own set of databases, cloud based serverless functions (AWS LAmbda)
            as well as their own set of users (<a href=https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/ >Amazon Cognito</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            I created a local working environment for the developers on the project to allow local machine development 
            without causing disprutions to other developers. I set up a Docker container for a local database and used <a href= https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/serverless_app.html>AWS SAM 
            (Serverless Application Model)</a> to build and test their backend functions locally.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was an incredible journey and has been a priceless learning experience for me.I was faced with many 
            challenges during this project and feel that I learned far more than I have during any of
            my past experiences. I also feel that I developed my skill as a leader and grew as a person, bringing me closer to 
            my preofessional goals.
