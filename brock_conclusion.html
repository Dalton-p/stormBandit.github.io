			Brock Solutions was a great place to work, and gain experience relevant to my career goals.
			Being that I had previously worked in a startup company, there was quite a 'cultural shock'
			when I first started. The dynamics of the two workplaces are much different, and I feel greatful
			for being able to experience the structured, team based, goal driven environment at Brock Solutions.
			The incredible team atmosphere was enlightening, there was always a team member available to assist me 
			in even the smallest of tasks. The goal oriented atmosphere was also something I found valuable, having
			constant updates on timelines, release dates, due dates for proposals etc. As a developer I sometimes 
			worry about the speed at which I get things done, having frequent updates on timeline for project 
			completion takes a lot of that stress away.
