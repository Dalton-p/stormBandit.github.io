        <p>
            The work environment at Adknown is highly demanding, technical abilities are tested and there is a lot to learn, that being said the company
            is a great place to work if you are looking for a challenge and to gain a sense of accomplishment. There is a string focus on accomplishing the goals
            set forth not creating the perfect solutions, this is key to a successful agile environment. Their continuous delivery allows quick changes to be made
            in production and demands hotfixes to be made on a weekly basis, which keeps the developers on their toes.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Adknown team understands that all work and no play makes for miserable developers, so to lighten to mood in the office
            there is a fully stocked bar, a games room and a light comedic atmosphere on the internal messaging system. The various teams also go out for lunch
            once a week for a social meal where they are able to interact more with the other members and get to know each other, facilitating a friendly culture
            in the office.
